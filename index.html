            <h3>Why Costa Rica?</h3>
            <h2>Knowing about Costa Rica before you go!</h2>
            <p>
              Costa Rica is a country located in Central America that is ranked
              as one of the most visited international destinations. One of
              Costa Rica's main sources of income is tourism. Costa Rica is a
              democratic and peaceful country and it has not had an army since
              the year 1948. Although the country is small and it covers only
              0.03 percent of the surface of the globe, it proudly shelters 5
              percent of the existing biodiversity in the entire world. Twenty
              six percent of the country is composed of conservation and natural
              protected territory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, 2018 has become a magnet for meeting tourism with the
              opening of the National Congress and Convention Center (CNCC),
              which can welcome some 4,600 people to its meetings. Located eight
              kilometers from the Juan Santamaría International Airport and just
              10 kilometers from San José, the new space will bring together
              people from different backgrounds and cultures to exchange
              experiences and new businesses. Costa Rica is also an attractive
              country for investment and offers great potential for the
              establishment of important multinational companies, thanks to the
              outstanding academic level of its population, as well as the high
              standard of modern services and social and political stability.
