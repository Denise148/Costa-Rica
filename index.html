            <h3>Why Costa Rica?</h3>
            <h2>Knowing about Costa Rica before you go!</h2>
            <p>
              Costa Rica is a country located in Central America that is ranked
              as one of the most visited international destinations. One of
              Costa Rica's main sources of income is tourism. Costa Rica is a
              democratic and peaceful country and it has not had an army since
              the year 1948. Although the country is small and it covers only
              0.03 percent of the surface of the globe, it proudly shelters 5
              percent of the existing biodiversity in the entire world. Twenty
              six percent of the country is composed of conservation and natural
              protected territory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, 2018 has become a magnet for meeting tourism with the
              opening of the National Congress and Convention Center (CNCC),
              which can welcome some 4,600 people to its meetings. Located eight
              kilometers from the Juan Santamaría International Airport and just
              10 kilometers from San José, the new space will bring together
              people from different backgrounds and cultures to exchange
              experiences and new businesses. Costa Rica is also an attractive
              country for investment and offers great potential for the
              establishment of important multinational companies, thanks to the
              outstanding academic level of its population, as well as the high
              standard of modern services and social and political stability.

                <h4>Rio Celeste</h4>
                <p>
                  Rio Celeste is well known for it brilliant blue waters, making
                  it a famous attraction in Costa Rica. The blue water comes
                  from a mix of volcanic rock within the water and it’s almost
                  impossible to capture how luminescent the water really is in a
                  photo. Seeing it first hand is the only way to truly admire
                  the waterfall. The falls drop down 30 meters (100 feet) into
                  the vibrant sky blue pool. Moreover, there are trails all
                  throughout Tenorio Volcano National Park that are highly
                  maintained.

                <h4>Nauyaca</h4>
                <p>
                  Nauyaca is astonishing because it has a spectacular two level
                  drop. The first one is 45 meters high (150 feet) and then it
                  comes to another fall of 20 meters (65 feet) totaling 65
                  meters (200 feet). This is by far the best waterfall for
                  swimming. Nauyaca has a huge 100 square meter (1000 square
                  feet) pool at the bottom of the falls. Swimming here is an
                  unforgettable experience but be aware that the pool is up to 6
                  meters (20 feet) deep!

                <h4>Bajos del Toro</h4>
                <p>
                  Bajos del Toro is yet another amazing site is located in the
                  province of Alajuela, in the remote mountains north of the
                  Central Valley. The water from the insane waterfall comes from
                  the Poas Volcano. As the water falls over the rock edge, a
                  beautiful mist surrounds the waterfall. You will see plants
                  that are torched because of the volcanic water. The waterfall
                  is surrounded by primary forest which makes it easy to spot a
                  variety of wildlife. Bajos del Toro is 90 meters tall (300
                  feet) making it one of the making it one of the tallest Costa
                  Rica waterfalls.
